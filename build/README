Building and testing InstallerLG
================================

Unless changes have been made to the parser or lexer, a simple 'make' will build
the 'installer' binary on AROS / MorphOS and 'make dist' in the 'dist' directory
will create an lha archive for distribution.  If modifications have been made to
the parser or the lexer,  the 'parser.c', 'parser.h' and 'lexer.c' files have to
be regenerated (the Bison shipped with AROS and MorphOS seems broken) on a Linux
system (or some other system with an up to date Bison).

In order to execute all the tests, a Linux system with an up to date Valgrind is
strongly recommended.  It is possible to execute the tests on MacOS as well (and
probably on other systems with a POSIX shell) but then you'll miss out on memory
and file handle checks (leaks / illegal reading / writing),  and that's probably
not something you want to do without. By invoking 'make test', all tests will be
executed. It is currently not possible to execute tests on AROS or MorphOS.
has been replaced by a less outdated MUI / Zune based one.
