Building and testing InstallerLG
================================

Unless changes have been made to the parser or lexer, a simple 'make' will build
the 'installer' binary (for AROS / MorphOS). An lha archive fit for distribution
can be created by invoking 'make dist' in the 'dist' directory. If modifications
have been made to the parser or the lexer, the parser.c|h and lexer.c files have
to be regenerated on a Linux system (or some other system with a recent Bison).

To execute the tests, a Linux system with Valgrind is recommended. It's possible
to execute the tests on other systems with a POSIX shell (e.g MacOS) but then no
checks for memory leaks / illegal reads / writes or leaking file handles will be
done. By running 'make test', all tests will be executed.  This is currently not
possible on AROS or MorphOS.

To build an interactive cli-based version of the installer the variable INTERFACE
can be set to CLI.  E.g.

make INTERFACE=CLI
make -f Makefile.vbcc INTERFACE=CLI
