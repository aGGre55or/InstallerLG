- (textfile) should take several (append):s, each with multiple children. Like (startup) and (command).
- The GUI is all over the place. It should be in one place.
- Check how bitwise + signed int work in 3.9.
- Check list mgmt for mem leaks.
- All project tooltypes must be promoted to variables in init().
- OpenLocale() -> @installer-language
- We need @strict = 0 testing on the gui parts. What is shown when we have nothing to show?
- We have no (optional) test coverage on (copylib).
- We have no (confirm) test coverage on (startup).
- We need more @strict = 0 testing on (copylib).
- We need (confirm) test feedback from (copyfiles).
- (onerror) and (trap) should likely accept naked blocks just list (while), (until) and (foreach)
- (showmedia) seems to be a thing? (>= V44), refer to IBrowse script.
