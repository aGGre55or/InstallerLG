- The GUI is all over the place. It should be in one place.
- All project tooltypes must be promoted to variables in init().
- OpenLocale() -> @installer-language
- We need @strict = 0 testing on the gui parts. What is shown when we have nothing to show?
- We have no (optional) test coverage on (copylib).
- We have no (confirm) test coverage on (startup).
- We need more @strict = 0 testing on (copylib).
- We need (confirm) test feedback from (copyfiles).
- amrss - when in expert mode you get garbage in one of the file listers.
- (onerror) and (trap) should likely accept naked blocks just list (while), (until) and (foreach)
- in places where we *only* have options and no CARG(x) (such as (ask*)) allow
  options to be resolved vp:s. With this restriction there's very little risk for double
  resolves, while still coping with IBrowse funkiness. Create get_opt_va_ex for this.
  Or just create a special type of option, in the grammar, allowing only the absolute
  minimum. That way you can return options without poluting the rest of the grammar.
- (showmedia) seems to be a thing? (>= V44) refer to IBrowse script.
- Check how bitwise + signed int work in 3.9.
