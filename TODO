- All project tooltypes must be promoted to variables in init().
- We have no (optional) test coverage on (copylib).
- We have no (confirm) test coverage on (startup).
- We need more @strict = 0 testing on (copylib).
- We need (confirm) test feedback from (copyfiles).
- We have 32 / 64 bit problem. Look at test.bitnot on Linux 32.
- (onerror) and (trap) should likely accept naked blocks just list (while), (until) and (foreach)
- The GUI is all over the place.
- FIXME:s
