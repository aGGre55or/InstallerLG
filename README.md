# InstallerLG

A reimplementation of the LISP-like Installer scripting language included in
AmigaOS as of version 2.1. InstallerLG aims to be wholly compatible with the
the original as described in the V44.10 documentation. Most resource related
limitations of the Commodore implementation have been eliminated and the GUI
has been replaced by a MUI / Zune based one.
