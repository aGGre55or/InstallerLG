# InstallerLG

A reimplementation of the LISP-like Installer scripting language included in
AmigaOS as of version 2.1. InstallerLG is fully compatible with the original
as described in the V44.10 documentation. Most resource limitations of the
Commodore implementation have been resolved and the GUI has been replaced by
a MUI / Zune based one.
